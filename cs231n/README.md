### assignment1
In this assignment you will practice putting together a simple image classification pipeline based on the k-Nearest Neighbor or the SVM/Softmax classifier. The goals of this assignment are as follows:

- Understand the basic Image Classification pipeline and the data-driven approach (train/predict stages)
- Understand the train/val/test splits and the use of validation data for hyperparameter tuning.
- Develop proficiency in writing efficient vectorized code with numpy
- Implement and apply a k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) classifier
- Implement and apply a Multiclass Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier
- Implement and apply a Softmax classifier
- Implement and apply a Two layer neural network classifier
- Understand the differences and tradeoffs between these classifiers
- Get a basic understanding of performance improvements from using higher-level representations as opposed to raw pixels, e.g. color histograms, Histogram of Gradient (HOG) features, etc.

### assignment2
In this assignment you will practice writing backpropagation code, and training Neural Networks and Convolutional Neural Networks. The goals of this assignment are as follows:

- Understand Neural Networks and how they are arranged in layered architectures.
- Understand and be able to implement (vectorized) backpropagation.
- Implement various update rules used to optimize Neural Networks.

### assignment3
In this assignment, you will implement recurrent neural networks and apply them to image captioning on the Microsoft COCO data. You will also explore methods for visualizing the features of a pretrained model on ImageNet, and use this model to implement Style Transfer. Finally, you will train a Generative Adversarial Network to generate images that look like a training dataset! The goals of this assignment are as follows:

- Understand the architecture of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and how they operate on sequences by sharing weights over time.
- Understand and implement both Vanilla RNNs and Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) networks.
- Understand how to combine convolutional neural nets and recurrent nets to implement an image captioning system.
- Explore various applications of image gradients, including saliency maps, fooling images, class visualizations.
- Understand and implement techniques for image style transfer.
- Understand how to train and implement a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to produce images that resemble samples from a dataset.
